# Advent of Christimas 2017
I learned about the 'festival' in the 3rd day, so two of the puzzles are
post-facto, I do am keeping up with the new puzzles! Enjoy!

## Installing & Running
Use `stack install` to compile and copy the final executable to your
`~/.local/bin`. The executable will try to parse it's first argument as int
representing the day to run, if it doesn't find one, it asks for the problem
number from stdin.

## Inputs
The xmas<n>.txt files are the inputs! Change them to your own and the
algorithms should work as-is.
